- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tomagnin, Fernando Tomagnin Pereira
- 👀 I am in a career transition, where I worked for 23 years in a multinational in the automobile sector, my career was focused more on the corporate security area. I believe I can use a lot of what I've learned in these 23 years as a front-end developer. I am very excited, happy and confident about this new phase of my life.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning HTML5, and studying English (I'm still at a basic level), I intend to become a Front-End Dev and perhaps a Full-Stack in the future.
- 💞️ I know it's still very early and I still need to learn a lot, but I'll be happy to help (learn) in any project related to the topic I'm studying.
